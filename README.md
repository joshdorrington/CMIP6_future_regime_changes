# CMIP6 future regime changes

## This repository contains files needed to reproduce the results of the paper 'Wintertime blocking regimes over Europe are projected to become less persistent in a warming climate', written by Josh Dorrington, Kristian Strommen, Federico Fabiano and Franco Molteni. It contains:

*EOF_data.zip: A folder of netcdf files encoding the first 10 EOFs of each CMIP6 model dataset

*PC_data.zip: A folder of netcdf files encoding the first 10 pcs of each CMIP6 model dataset

*temporal_statistics.csv: A file containing historical and SSP5:8.5 occurrence and persistence statitistics for all models

To fully replicate all results, raw CMIP6 data must be analysed, as discussed in the paper. The analysis code required to do so was already published and documented in https://github.com/joshdorrington/GJR_hist_climate_data

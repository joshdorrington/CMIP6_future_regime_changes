* hist_patterns.nc: CMIP6 historical patterns
* fut_patterns.nc: CMIP6 SSP5:8.5 patterns
* hist_occ.nc, hist_pers.nc: CMIP6 historical occurrence and persistence statistics
* fut_occ.nc, fut_pers.nc: CMIP6 SSP5:8.5 occurrence and persistence statistics
* hist_js.nc, hist_pcs.nc, hist_eofs.nc: CMIP6 historical jet speed, principal components and EOFs.
* fut_js.nc,fut_pcs.nc,fut_eofs.nc: CMIP6 SSP5:8.5 jet speed, principal components and EOFs.

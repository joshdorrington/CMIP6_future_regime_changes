*EOF_data.zip: A folder of netcdf files encoding the first 10 EOFs of each CMIP6 model dataset
*PC_data.zip: A folder of netcdf files encoding the first 10 pcs of each CMIP6 model dataset
*temporal_statistics.csv: A file containing historical and SSP5:8.5 occurrence and persistence statitistics for all models
* hist_patterns.nc: CMIP6 historical patterns
* fut_patterns.nc: CMIP6 SSP5:8.5 patterns
